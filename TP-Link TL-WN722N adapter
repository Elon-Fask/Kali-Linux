I've didn't change a lot from Mr.David text file, i've just changed the rtl8188eus repo file from aircrackng to another repo from drygdryg, 
why ?
becaue it's works, not like rtl8188eus file from aircrack, the majority of users fave this error;
at the moment you start running the " make command ", you'll find more description of this error in the issus section.

I've faced the same error, and i've tried to change the scripte on the file, but that cause more errors,
and then i fount another rtl8188eus repo and after the last apdate of kali linux (2022-02-10), and with a new version of kali header and kernel, 
no error shows up, but with a small change on the line with the echo command,
 
hope that everyone understand, if you face any error, don't wait tell tomorrow ;)
